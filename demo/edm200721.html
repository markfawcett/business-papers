			<p>That this House believes every penny spent on NHS privatisation and outsourcing is a penny less spent on patient care; recognises the urgent need to fully repeal the Health and Social Care Act 2012, reinstate the responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to provide a free, comprehensive, universal healthcare system, and end the requirement on health authorities to put services out to competitive tender; accepts the undisputed accuracy of the information on that matter contained within the UK-US Trade and Investment Working Group documents which cover meetings that took place between 2017 and 2018 and came to light during the 2019 general election campaign; affirms that insurance based health service systems, such as in the US, leave many millions without healthcare and are more expensive and less efficient than the UK’s NHS; and acknowledges that the NHS must not be on the table in any negotiations for a trade deal between the UK and United States and that such a development would risk paving the way for a US style health insurance system in the UK, significantly to the detriment of the health and well-being of the UK population.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises that workers in some UK garment factories are suffering under exploitative labour practices, underpayment of legal minimum wages and unsafe working conditions; acknowledges the need to take urgent action to protect such workers from exploitation and ensure that factory owners are meeting all legal obligations; notes that taking action would prevent rogue factories from undercutting compliant businesses and would encourage retailers to source more clothing from the UK, supporting the development of an ethical, world-leading UK fashion industry; and therefore calls on the Government to implement the British Retail Consortium’s proposal for a Fit to Trade licensing scheme for all garment factories in the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House condemns the Government’s cruel universal credit assessment period regulations which result in people who are paid every four weeks rather than every calendar month being penalised; notes that as a result of those regulations the Department for Work and Pensions sometimes disqualifies an individual from receiving universal credit which can also lead to the local authority ceasing to provide some means of support; expresses its concern that those who wish to appeal the decision have to go through a lengthy mandatory reconsideration process; further notes with regret that 85,000 people are currently estimated to be affected by that mandatory reconsideration process; welcomes the recent Court of Appeal ruling that those regulations are unlawful; and calls on the Government to urgently bring forward measures to fix the broken welfare system.</p>

			<p>That this House calls on the Government to provide vital funding for universities that are under mass financial strain; notes this is not an unexpected side effect from the covid-19 outbreak, but that the outbreak has worsened pre-existing problems resulting from a lack of financial Government support of higher education and the marketisation of education; further notes that thirteen universities, as found by the ISF, will face bankruptcy without a Government bail-out; recognises that SOAS University, the only higher education institution in the UK specialising in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, is currently facing a mass restructuring as a result of long term financial strain that has worsened with the covid-19 outbreak; and calls on the Government to take action to provide essential support for those institutions.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the clear and unambiguous ruling of the Lord Chief Justice in the case of journalists Barry McCaffrey and Trevor Birney, whose arrests for their role in making the award-winning documentary No Stone Unturned about the Loughinsland massacre were judge to be unlawful; notes that the arrests were carried out by Durham Constabulary at the behest of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) on warrants issued outside the correct legal framework;  further welcomes the recent unreserved apology made to the two journalists by the PSNI, which committed to reviewing the legal judgement to learn all appropriate lessons;  believes that not only were the unlawful arrests a cause of distress, the position of the police since the illegal detentions has had a devastating impact on those two NUJ members; notes that the PSNI still retains a vast amount of journalistic material despite the issue of the court order; calls on the Chief Constable to demonstrate the sincerity of the apology by bringing to an end this shameful episode by arranging the immediate return of all material seized or copied; and further calls on the PSNI to act on the information contained in No Stone Unturrned to ensure that justice is delivered for the families of the Loughinisland victims.</p>

			<p>This House notes that as part of the emergency funding deal for Transport for London the Government has insisted on the suspension of free travel for under 18 year olds in London, despite children and young people being able to travel around the capital for free, or at a discounted rate since 2005; expresses concern about the effect of this policy on low income households in a city where 37 per cent of all children are living in poverty; recognises that the decision will reverse the significant benefits of the policy which academic research has shown to include greater social inclusion, reduced car use, and reduced road casualties; recognises the acute need for investment in young people to compensate for the pause in education during the covid-19 outbreak; further recognises the significant opposition to the policy by London’s young people including a petition by Joshua Brown-Smith with has already gathered over 185,000 signatures, along with the opposition by Child Poverty Action Campaign in their #DontZapTheZip campaign; and calls on the Government to drop its harmful plans for suspending free and discounted travel for children and young people in London.</p>
