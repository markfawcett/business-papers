			<p>That this House recognises that it has been one year since the all-party Parliamentary group on Terminal Illness published its report on the legal definition of terminal illness; condemns the rules of the Department for Work and Pensions which mean that benefits are only fast-tracked if a terminally ill person has a diagnosis of six months or less to live; recognises that the Scottish Government has committed to ruling out the six month rule when it takes over the personal independence payment; and urges the Government to do the same.</p>
