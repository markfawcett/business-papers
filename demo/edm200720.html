			<p>That this House is concerned that students with disabilities face a financial barrier when accessing assistive technology and other miscellaneous equipment as a result of the £200 minimum contribution required from the Disabled Students Allowance; notes that the implication of that cost is likely to be magnified as a result of the transition to e-learning following the covid-19 outbreak; calls on the Government to acknowledge the effect of that barrier on accessing higher education and on social mobility, and further calls on the Government to implement alternative mechanisms to ensure that a lack of finance is no longer a significant barrier to inclusive education opportunities for students with disabilities.</p>

			<p>This House expresses its concern at the number of covid-19 cases in Bangladesh; recognises the efforts being made in Bangladesh to find a vaccine to the virus; notes that a study from Public Health England has found that those of Bangladeshi heritage are twice as likely to die from covid-19 as those of white British ethnicity, highlighting that Government policy in the UK and abroad must reflect the unequal impact that the virus has across BAME communities; and calls on the Government to support the tackling of covid-19 in Bangladesh in every way possible.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Dr Lisa Cameron</p>
			<p>That this House notes the important and liberating effect of hearing loops on hearing-impaired people, allowing them to participate in public events and meetings; agrees that too few venues have hearing loops, which is in breach of the obligations set out in the Equality Act 2010; acknowledges the negative impact of a lack of hearing loops on the confidence of people who have impaired hearing; commends the Institute of Sound &amp; Communications Engineers for their Hearing Loop Assessment Scheme, aimed at evaluating and improving poorly-installed hearing loop systems; recognises the importance of venues being accessible to all people with disabilities so that there is a more inclusive society; and calls on the Government to ensure that organisations meet their obligations through the Equality Act 2010 so that people with a hearing impairment can be reconnected to important public matters;</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Paula Barker</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the extraordinary commitment and sacrifice of NHS staff throughout the covid-19 outbreak; believes that the depth of public gratitude for this work must now be reflected in what the Government does next for NHS staff; notes that as it stands, NHS staff must wait until 2021 for their next pay rise despite having gone above and beyond during the covid-19 outbreak; recognises the importance of improving pay to tackle the vacancies that exist across all parts of the NHS workforce; and calls on the Government to show its support for the NHS by turning warm words and applause into a firm commitment to bring forward NHS pay talks and to fund an early and meaningful pay rise.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">John McDonnell</p>
			<p>That this House calls on the Government to provide vital funding for universities that are under mass financial strain; notes this is not an unexpected side effect from the covid-19 outbreak, but that the outbreak has worsened pre-existing problems resulting from a lack of financial Government support of higher education and the marketisation of education; further notes that thirteen universities, as found by the ISF, will face bankruptcy without a Government bail-out; recognises that SOAS University, the only higher education institution in the UK specialising in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, is currently facing a mass restructuring as a result of long term financial strain that has worsened with the covid-19 outbreak; and calls on the Government to take action to provide essential support for those institutions.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Paula Barker</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ian Byrne</p>
			<p>That this House notes with great concern that orders to supply materials and products to housing associations, local authorities and other public services have in many cases, been put on hold; further notes that many of those suppliers still have high numbers of their workers on the Government’s furlough scheme as a consequence of the lack of orders and are having to consider substantially downsizing their business and the size of their workforce, which would lead to a national loss of construction supply capacity once the furlough scheme ends; and calls on the Government to hold urgent talks with housing associations, local authorities and other public bodies to encourage them to bring forward orders.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the clear and unambiguous ruling of the Lord Chief Justice in the case of journalists Barry McCaffrey and Trevor Birney, whose arrests for their role in making the award-winning documentary No Stone Unturned about the Loughinsland massacre were judge to be unlawful; notes that the arrests were carried out by Durham Constabulary at the behest of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) on warrants issued outside the correct legal framework;  further welcomes the recent unreserved apology made to the two journalists by the PSNI, which committed to reviewing the legal judgement to learn all appropriate lessons;  believes that not only were the unlawful arrests a cause of distress, the position of the police since the illegal detentions has had a devastating impact on those two NUJ members; notes that the PSNI still retains a vast amount of journalistic material despite the issue of the court order; calls on the Chief Constable to demonstrate the sincerity of the apology by bringing to an end this shameful episode by arranging the immediate return of all material seized or copied; and further calls on the PSNI to act on the information contained in No Stone Unturrned to ensure that justice is delivered for the families of the Loughinisland victims.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with great sadness the passing of the legendary Scottish actor, entertainer and performer, Johnny Beattie MBE at the age of 93; extends sincere sympathy to his family and friends; notes that, born in Glasgow in 1926, Johnny graced the stage in many, many, Gaiety Whirls and pantomimes at Ayr Gaiety Theatre and many other theatres during a theatrical and acting career which spanned  an incredible 63 years, the honorary president of the Scottish Music Hall Society, Beattie became a panto star, entertainer, TV quiz show host and actor touring North America with the Alexander Brothers and worked with legends such as Billy Connolly and was the long serving host of the annual televised Hogmanay show in which he demonstrated his credentials as a custodian of Scottish variety, appearing for 13 years as the character Malcolm in the BBC soap opera River City; recognises that he will be remembered with great fondness not only as one as one of the great Scottish variety performers and actors but for his unwavering support and campaigning when the Ayr Gaiety Theatre was threatened with closure – more than once and his theatre saving campaign slogan Let there be Gaiety – a legacy from a true giant in Scottish theatre who will always be known as Mr Gaiety by Ayrshire folk and one of Scotland's finest entertainers throughout Scotland and beyond.</p>
