			<p>That this House believes that free bets offered by gambling companies are designed to lock and trap people into gambling as a result of the requirement to provide deposit cash, bank and credit card details and personal details to gain access to those bets; notes that the advertising of free bets encourages people who are addicted to gambling or who cannot afford to gamble; and calls on the Government to implement a ban on the advertising of free bets, and the repetitive pop-up targeting of free bet advertisements online as a matter of urgency.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Munira Wilson</p>
			<p>That this House deplores the decision to exclude providers of 16-19 education from the Government’s catch-up funding for students after the covid-19 outbreak, notes that 16-19 year olds have missed out on months of their education at a crucial juncture where they would have been sitting exams and preparing to move into higher education, other training or entering the job market; further notes that for those nearing the end of their school career there is very limited time to catch up on the studies they have missed and as such those young people could find their future education, training and job opportunities permanently affected; and calls on the Government to urgently commit to providing catch-up funding for 16-19 education settings at the same level as is being provided for pupils in primary and secondary schools.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the contribution brought about by vehicle safety standards, consumer safety ratings and manufacturing initiatives to reducing death and serious injury in collisions on the UK's roads over the last 25 years; recognises with concern the scope for potential lowering of vehicle safety standards in negotiations on free trade agreements, particularly with the USA which has lower legislative standards of front and side impact protection and does not require safer car fronts for pedestrian and cyclists in car design; and calls on the Government to ensure that no vehicle is imported to the UK with lower than UK/EU vehicle safety standards.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that the mental health consequences of the covid-19 pandemic are immense and will be long-lasting; asserts that existing demand for mental health services is set to increase and agrees with The Royal College of Psychiatrists and the British Medical Association that mental health services, already buckling under the level of demand pre-covid-19 pandemic are now facing a potential tsunami of escalation without the resources to cope; further notes that research including the University of Oxford Co-SPACE survey have observed an increase in children’s mental health problems particularly in the years 4 to 10 age range; agrees with Professor Cathy Cresswell, Professor of Developmental Clinical Psychology at the University of Oxford that prioritising the mental health of children throughout the covid-19 pandemic and beyond is critical; notes that the announcement in the Queen’s Speech of December 2019 that the Mental Health Act 1989 will be reformed gave no specific mention of the urgent needs of children; and calls on the Government to commit to an early reform of the Mental Health Act 1989 during this Parliament and to guarantee that policies to prioritise the urgent mental health needs of children will be at the heart of the drafting of that new Bill and on the face of that Bill.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes news that Midlothian-based scientists have decoded the whole genetic make-up of pigs in a development that will facilitate the discovery of genetic variations linked to key traits; recognises that the study was led by scientists at the Roslin Institute and the US Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service Meat Animal Research Centre and involved 40 scientists from 15 laboratories in the UK and US; understands that the findings could help improve selective breeding and enable more accurate use of gene-editing technologies to develop pigs with desired characteristics, such as resistance to infectious diseases; further understands that knowledge of that genome also enables identification of genetic similarities between pigs and humans, which will enhance biomedical research in which pigs are used as models to study human health; and commends the Roslin Institute for its world-renowned innovation and hard work.</p>
