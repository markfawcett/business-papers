			<p>That this House notes that the mental health consequences of the covid-19 pandemic are immense and will be long-lasting; asserts that existing demand for mental health services is set to increase and agrees with The Royal College of Psychiatrists and the British Medical Association that mental health services, already buckling under the level of demand pre-covid-19 pandemic are now facing a potential tsunami of escalation without the resources to cope; further notes that research including the University of Oxford Co-SPACE survey have observed an increase in children’s mental health problems particularly in the years 4 to 10 age range; agrees with Professor Cathy Cresswell, Professor of Developmental Clinical Psychology at the University of Oxford that prioritising the mental health of children throughout the covid-19 pandemic and beyond is critical; notes that the announcement in the Queen’s Speech of December 2019 that the Mental Health Act 1989 will be reformed gave no specific mention of the urgent needs of children; and calls on the Government to commit to an early reform of the Mental Health Act 1989 during this Parliament and to guarantee that policies to prioritise the urgent mental health needs of children will be at the heart of the drafting of that new Bill and on the face of that Bill.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes news that Midlothian-based scientists have decoded the whole genetic make-up of pigs in a development that will facilitate the discovery of genetic variations linked to key traits; recognises that the study was led by scientists at the Roslin Institute and the US Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service Meat Animal Research Centre and involved 40 scientists from 15 laboratories in the UK and US; understands that the findings could help improve selective breeding and enable more accurate use of gene-editing technologies to develop pigs with desired characteristics, such as resistance to infectious diseases; further understands that knowledge of that genome also enables identification of genetic similarities between pigs and humans, which will enhance biomedical research in which pigs are used as models to study human health; and commends the Roslin Institute for its world-renowned innovation and hard work.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises prison officers carry out some of the hardest public service work in dangerous and often violent conditions; notes that prison officers are expected to continue to carry out this work until they are 68 years old; acknowledges that people living longer does not always equate to their physical and mental abilities being able to withstand the daily demands faced by prison officers; declares that prison officers’ retirement age should be aligned with that of police officers who can retire at 60 years old; urges the Government to accept that 68 is too old to cope with the physical and mental challenges of being a prison officer; and further urges the Government to give prison officers the same consideration as police officers, who deal with the same type of offenders on a daily basis.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the importance of ensuring that, upon their discovery, treatments and vaccines for covid-19 are shared equitably around the world; highlights that any potential vaccine should be made available to all internationally on the basis of need; notes that in advance of the discovery of a vaccine the UK Government must urge its allies including the US to participate in a system of international cooperation to ensure that vaccines are not simply sold to the highest bidder; and believes that a unified intergovernmental approach to vaccine distribution is not only the right thing to do, but is also the most efficient way to defeat the virus worldwide and prevent future pandemics.</p>

			<p>That this House acknowledges the publication of a report into the effect of covid-19 on call-centre workers by Philip Taylor, Professor of Work and Employment Studies, at the University of Strathclyde; recognises that the report raises concerns about unsafe working environments at many call centres including poor social distancing measures, hot-desking, poor cleansing and a lack of remote or home-working options; notes that the report records concerning levels of anxiety and fear among call-centre staff regarding their risk of catching or transferring covid-19 in their workplace; further notes that the report considers the matter to be as much a public health concern as an occupational health issue due to the risk of call centre workers spreading infection; appreciates that, while the document is focused on Scotland, the content and recommendations are equally applicable to the rest of the UK; further recognises that the report makes a number of recommendations including evacuating problematic workplaces, facilitating greater homeworking, auditing call centres and the implementation of appropriate health and safety and testing measures; and calls on the Government to reflect on the evidence and recommendations in that report and consider what actions it can take to help protect call centre workers throughout the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House calls on the Government to urgently reinstate the Intelligence and Security Committee so that it can publish the delayed report on alleged Russian Interference in UK democracy; notes that this is the longest period following an election that the Intelligence and Security Committee has gone without being reinstated; and calls on the Government to be fully transparent and open with the public about any activity which may compromise the integrity of our democracy.</p>

			<p>That this House believes that the decision to reinstate benefit sanctions in the middle of a health and economic crisis is a profoundly callous step; further believes that this is an ideologically driven, punitive measure which simply adds to the stress and anxiety for people who are already facing hard times; notes that removing benefits and forcing people to use food banks to feed their families does nothing to help anyone back to work; and urgently calls on the Government to extend the suspension of sanctions as the covid-19 crisis continues and the numbers claiming universal credit soar, with a view to scrapping benefit sanctions altogether.</p>
