			<p>That this House recognises the importance of World Hearing Day; applauds the work of the National Association of Deafened People (NADP) which seeks to highlight the importance of timely and effective interventions in order to ensure that those with hearing loss are able to achieve their full potential in all areas of life such as education, employment and communication; understands that interventions to address hearing loss such as funding cochlear implants, hearing aids and rehabilitation are cost effective; supports the work of the NADP to help remove barriers in society that restrict equal access to people with hearing loss so that they can enjoy a secure quality of life including employment, good quality hearing care and full and meaningful participation in all social activities; and understands that this could significantly reduce experiences of loneliness and isolation that deafened people often face.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens</p>
			<p>That this House believes that the universal credit benefit system continues to have a disproportionately harmful effect on tenants in social housing; is concerned that universal credit’s five week waiting period has forced social housing tenants who rely on this lifeline benefit into arrears and poverty; notes that research from the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations showed that nearly 65 per cent of social housing tenants claiming universal credit are in arrears, compared to 32 per cent of all other tenants; supports the aims of the Living Rent Charter which calls for an end to evictions arising from the design of universal credit; welcomes the support of the social landlords who sign up to the charter, agreeing to abstain from carrying out evictions due to arrears; and calls on housing associations across Scotland, and the rest of the UK, to consider signing up to a similar promise of ending evictions for claimants in arrears on universal credit.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir David Amess</p>

			<p>That this House acknowledges that many of the major diseases of our time remain poorly understood and lack adequate treatments; notes the economic, business and public health benefits of developing New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) that have the potential to reduce drug development failures and save costs and time; recognises that human relevant research methods that do not use animals avoid the problem of animal-human species differences that can result in misleading data; and supports the calls in the report entitled Accelerating the Growth of Human Relevant Life Sciences in the United Kingdom by The Alliance for Human Relevant Science, for the Government to provide supportive infrastructure, strategic funding, education, regulatory engagement and collaboration between industries in order to make the UK a global powerhouse in the development of NAMs.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Janet Daby</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the need to end sexual harassment and violence at work, which is a hidden epidemic that particularly affects women workers, as well as young and LGBTQ+ people; acknowledges with concern the joint TUC and Everyday Sexism Project study which found that one in two women in the UK have experienced sexual harassment at work and four out of five of these women do not report the abuse because of poor reporting systems or fear of repercussions; welcomes ILO Convention 190, which aims to end sexual harassment and violence in the world of work by comprehensively defining this type of abuse, including all workers irrespective of contract type, sector or work place, and setting minimum standards for preventing and addressing any breaches; recognises that the Government supported the adoption of this Convention at the ILO centennial meeting in June 2019, and that swift action to sign up to and champion this ground-breaking agreement could both assist workers in the UK and potentially encourage other countries to follow suit; and therefore urges the Government to ratify ILO Convention C190 as soon as possible.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Patricia Gibson</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens</p>
			<p>That this House recognises that the Equitable Life scandal remains an ongoing and significant injustice; notes that the majority of victims are retired factory shop workers, nurses, teachers, civil servants and small business owners who diligently saved for their retirement; is concerned that 12 years after the Government accepted the Parliamentary Ombudsman&apos;s findings that a decade of maladministration by UK Government regulators led to one million pension savers suffering multi-billion pound losses, 95 per cent of Equitable Life policyholders have received only 22 per cent of the money they lost as a consequence of UK Government maladministration; seeks a commitment that victims will receive the missing 78 per cent of their compensation entitlement; seeks a further commitment that the 10,000 pre-September 1992 WP annuitants are compensated on exactly the same terms as those who took their WP annuity after that date; and therefore calls on the Government to urgently increase the available funding from £1.5 billion to £4.1 billion to reflect the Treasury&apos;s own calculation of the true cost of full compensation to all victims.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Feryal Clark</p>
			<p>That this House recognises that the BBC is a national treasure, a public service the UK can be proud of, with world class programmes and services, that the public pay for; notes that whatever criticism there may be of the BBC’s news output, editorial decisions, governance, transparency, accountability and independence from government, public service broadcasting is a principle worth defending in its own right; further notes and condemns the Government’s recent briefing against the BBC, its threatened decriminalisation of the TV licence fee and the disastrous effect that that would have on UK public service broadcasting; notes the importance of the BBC for foreign diplomacy, the international respect it garners, and the global brand it offers in the context of the UK leaving the EU; is concerned about the rise of fake news, big data manipulation of democracies and other worrying technological trends that make it critical the UK public has access to a publicly accountable BBC that provides services which aim to inform, educate and build resilience to such dangerous trends; believes that the BBC positively influences the UK&apos;s media ecology through its high standards and investment in local, quality content; and further recognises the We Own It campaign backed by The New Weather Institute that calls for the BBC to stay a publicly-owned and funded public service broadcaster, a genuine and open process to make sure that the BBC has fair, sustainable funding for the long-term, and a BBC that enshrines greater transparency, accountability and independence to better serve the public in the 21st century.</p>

			<p>That this House is very concerned that 2.2 billion people around the world still don’t have a reliable source of clean water; believes that far too little is being done to help the most vulnerable people adapt to climate change; notes that access to a reliable source of clean water which can withstand the impacts of climate change can mean the difference between life and death, and that this makes access to basic water and sanitation services a first line of defence against climate change; recognises that failure to adapt now will cost significantly more in the long run and threatens the lives and livelihoods of millions of people; and calls for the Government to recognise and prioritise water services in climate change plans at COP26.</p>

			<p>That this House calls on the Government to take urgent action to protect free access to cash for people across the UK, which the UK’s largest cashpoint network, Link, has warned will collapse within two years without immediate intervention; understands that since January 2018, one in five free to use cashpoints has closed, around 9,500 across the UK, and that consumers currently spend a staggering £100 million a year just to withdraw their own money; acknowledges that this comes on the backdrop of the closure of thousands of bank branches and post offices, with these closures being particularly damaging to more rural communities, and there has been no replacement for these services; recognises that access to free cash is vitally important to some of our most vulnerable communities, many of whom are digitally excluded, such as pensioners and those on low incomes; appreciates that the loss of free cash machines is occurring at a much higher rate in more socially disadvantaged areas, forcing already poor communities to pay significant fees to access their cash, affecting their ability to pay for necessities; and calls on the Government to bring forward legislation to  ensure that the provision of free access to cash is protected so that no community is left behind in an increasingly digital society.</p>
